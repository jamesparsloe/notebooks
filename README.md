# Notebooks

Just playing around.

These notebooks are self-contained (apart from third-party packages/dependencies) and _should_ run on Colab. They're just a place for me to quickly test out new ideas, things I'm learning, and have somewhere to copy and paste from when I need it.

| Notebook | Description |

| [Mamba MNIST](./mamba-mnist.ipynb) | Applying Mamba to conditional MNIST generation |
